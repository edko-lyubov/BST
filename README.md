# BST

Investigate experimentally the average height of BST trees (with duplicates) built from words of the Polish language.

Experiments are carried out for trees with different number of elements (100 to 10000 in steps of 100) and random words from the following sets:

1. {OSA, KOS, AS, LAS}; 
2. Words up to 4 letters long;
3. All words.

Checking the average number of compare operations for these cases with:
- insertion,
- searching,
- deleting elements from the tree.
